## Virtual Black Box 2.0
#### Virtual Black Box 2.0 is a special program that demonstrates the principle of a new method of saving important information from airplanes, which is called flight data (for more information, see my [article](http://jrnl.nau.edu.ua/index.php/ESU/article/viewFile/11682/15519 "CONTROL OF FLIGHT PARAMETERS WITH CLOUDY TECHNOLOGIES")). A flight recorder is also known like a black box is an electronic recording device placed in an aircraft for the purpose of facilitating the investigation of aviation accidents and incidents.
Two main processes:
* 1st - recording flight data to cloud storage. Flight parameters comes from Flight Gear (flight simulator) and recording in database.
* 2nd - reading parameters from cloud database. These parameters are represented in listView and on charts.
#### All processes occur in real time.
